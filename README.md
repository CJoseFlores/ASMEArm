# ASME CuriosityJr Arm Team

### Main Branch

Note: This branch contains completely functional code. If you want to see the current experimental code and want to help out, please use the ["arm" branch](https://github.com/KingTarrion/ASMEArm/tree/arm)

### Completed Objectives:

1. All motors are wired up to the RasberryPi and functional.
	
2. Motor class is functional. The constructor for the Motor class is as follows:
  * SomeMotor = Motor(Initialization_Pin,MotorRight_Pin,MotorLeft_Pin)
